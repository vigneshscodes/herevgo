## HereVGo – A Vehicle Pooling Web App for Day Scholars

I used React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and Firebase for the backend and authentication as part of my web development course project.

Users can either share a ride or find a ride. The ride details are available under the "Current Accepted Rides" and "Current Found Rides" sections, respectively. While the idea is valuable, potential issues such as trust and user verification have not yet been addressed. Additionally, features like payment integration, in-app chat, live location tracking, and a reward system, when implemented, will significantly enhance the functionality and value of the project. 

For demonstration purposes, a formal sample VIT email ID such as arjun.a2020@vitstudent.ac.in can be used instead of original IDs. Additionally, both ride sharing and ride finding can be performed using the same account to effectively showcase the functionality.

Let’s take two users: A and B.
A decides to share his ride.
B needs to travel, so he chooses to find a ride.
B selects A’s ride, which then appears on his "Current Found Rides" page.
A can view the booking on his "Current Booked Rides" page.
An OTP exchange ensures verification.
